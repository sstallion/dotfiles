# hist - zsh history configuration

# By default, zsh does not define HISTFILE; this is required in order to
# save history when the shell exits:
if [ -z "$HISTFILE" ]; then
    HISTFILE=$HOME/.zsh_history
fi

HISTSIZE=4096
SAVEHIST=4096

# Search for matches in history up to the current cursor position:

autoload -U down-line-or-beginning-search

zle -N up-line-or-beginning-search
zle -N down-line-or-beginning-search
